# Project-26
Items Needed

Three 8-inch x 2-inch round cake pans
Mixing bowls
Measuring cups and spoons
Sifter
Knife or offset spatula
Optional: A hand mixer for the frosting

Recipe

In a large bowl, sift the flour, sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into a large bowl. Whisk the ingredients together by hand.
In another bowl, combine the buttermilk, oil, eggs, vanilla, and coffee. 
Add the wet ingredients to the dry and gently mix the batter. 
Pour the batter into three buttered and lined 8-inch x 2-inch round cake pans.
Bake at 350°F (180°C) for 30 to 35 minutes, but check to make sure you’re not overcooking after 25 minutes.
Let the pans cool for 30 minutes, then turn them onto a cooling rack, allowing them to cool completely.
While you’re waiting for your cake to cool, prepare the fudge frosting! Here’s how:

Using an electric mixer, beat room temperature butter until lightly fluffy. Add sifted powder sugar 1 spoon at a time and mix well. 
Add vanilla, cocoa, and milk. Scrape the sides of the bowl down as you go.
Turn mixer on medium-high and beat until the frosting is fluffy and of spreading consistency. 

Tips

DON’T overbeat your batter! Overbeating your batter will result in a tough cake.
Make sure you check on your cakes after 25 minutes of baking to avoid overcooking. 
Make sure the cake cools completely before frosting, otherwise you’ll have a melty frosting mess.

If you do not want to use eggs in this cake you’re in luck! The eggs can be replaced with a flax egg. The cake might not be quite as rich but will still be lovely and have great texture.
